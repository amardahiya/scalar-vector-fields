======= Matlab notebook for producing the Matlab plots =======

We first initialize the height and radius of the mountain.

!bc mpro
h0 = 2277;   
R = 4;  
!ec

The following code defines the grid for the function $h(x,y)$ defined by Equation (ref{plot:surf:heq}) in Section ref{plot:surf:mesh_surf}.

@@@CODE src/plot3d_matlab.m from-to: % Grid for x, y@% endinitgrid
The coordinates of the parameterized curve $\bm{r}(t)$ defined by Equation ref{plot:surf:req} 
in Section ref{plot:surf:3Dcurve} are computed as follows.

@@@CODE src/plot3d_matlab.m fromto: s = linspace@% endparamcurve

The gradient field of $h(x,y)$ and its grid are produced as follows.

===== Surface plots =====

Figure ref{plotmatlab} is produced as follows

@@@CODE src/plot3d_matlab.m fromto:% Simple plot of mountain@% endsimpleplots



=====  Contour plots =====

The following code produces the plots in Figure ref{simplecontourmatlab} and Figure ref{advancedcontourmatlab}.

===== Vector field plots =====

Figure ref{plot:surf:matlab:quiver:fig} is produced as follows.
