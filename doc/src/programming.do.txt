TITLE: Computational linear algebra and visualization of scalar and vector fields
AUTHOR: Ã˜yvind Ryan {copyright} at Department of Mathematics, University of Oslo
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen {copyright} at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Department of Informatics, University of Oslo

__Preface.__ This note gives an introduction to basic, numerical
linear algebra operations and to visualization of two-dimensional
scalar and vector fields. The material is taken from Chapter 5 in the
forth-coming 5th edition of the book *A Primer on Scientific
Programming with Python* cite{Langtangen_2014}, but provided here
with some extensions.
